						<h3>Graduate students</h3>
						<p></p>
						<p>The Yang Lab can accept graduate students from Cancer Biology (CCB), Hunam Genetics, Genetics, Genomics & Systems Biology (GGSB), Biophysics and MSTP program. If you are interested in genetics, genomics, cancer biology, bioinformatics, please contact the PI. Experiences in cancer biology or genomics are prefered, but not required.</p>
						<h3>Postdoc positions</h3>
						<p></p>
						<p>The Yang Lab is seeking self-motivated individuals with strong background in cancer biology and cancer genomics to study genome instability of cancer. The main goal of the lab is to dissect the molecular mechanisms leading to somatic alterations, identify disease-causing events, and understand how the genetic alterations affect treatment response by combining computational and experimental approaches.</p>
            <br>Responsibilities:</br>
            <p>The applicant will have the opportunities to tackle cutting edge problems in biomedical field, interact with world class scientists, and gain experiences and develop skillsets for their next career stage. The experimental biologist is expected to develop new experimental assays to study the functional impacts of genome instability in cancer initiation and progression as well as to understand the mechanisms of genome instability. The computational biologist is expected to develop new computational algorithms, perform data analysis, collaborate with biologists and physicians. He or she will lead multiple projects, work in a multidisciplinary environment and present/publish the results in scientific conferences/journals.</p>
            <p>Qualifications:<br>
            - Recent Ph.D. in molecular biology, cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, computational biology, bioinformatics, statistics, computer science or related discipline.<br>
            - The experimental biologist is expected to be experienced in molecular biology and cell culture. Experience with cancer biology and CRISPR gene editing is preferred.<br>
            - The computational biologist is expected to be experienced in Unix/Linux shell, at least one of the following programming languages: C++, PERL, Python, R, Java, and high-throughput sequencing data (WGS, WES, RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq) analysis.<br>
            - Excellent oral and written communication skills are essential.</p>
            <p>To apply, please email your CV, two representative publications, contact information for three references to the PI Dr. Lixing Yang.</p>
